</p>
"Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the  <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="id-177" data-page-number="177" data-page-name="Page:Lewis Carroll - Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.djvu/197" data-page-index="197" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:Lewis_Carroll_-_Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland.djvu/197"/></span><div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/File:Alice_par_John_Tenniel_40.png" class="image"><img alt="Alice par John Tenniel 40.png" src="images/c53_Alice_par_John_Tenniel_40.png_400px_Alice_par_John_Tenniel_40.png" decoding="async" style="width:400; height:486; " data-title="Alice_par_John_Tenniel_40.png-400px-Alice_par_John_Tenniel_40.png"/></a></div></div>
<p>accident of the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

</p><p>Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," she said to herself; "I should think it would be <i>quite</i> as much use in the trial one way up as the other."
</p><p>As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.

</p><p>"Nothing," said Alice.
</p><p>"Nothing <i>whatever?</i>" persisted the King.
</p><p>"Nothing whatever," said Alice.
</p><p>"That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: "<i>Un</i>important, your Majesty means, of course," he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
</p><p>"<i>Un</i>important, of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, "important—unimportant—unimportant—important<span class="__bar"><span class="__bar_inner">——</span></span>" as if he were trying which word sounded best.
</p><p>Some of the jury wrote it down "important," and some "unimportant." Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; "but it doesn't matter a bit," she thought to herself.

</p><p>Everybody looked at Alice.
</p><p>"<i>I'm</i> not a mile high," said Alice.
</p><p>"You are," said the King.
</p><p>"Nearly two miles high," added the Queen.
</p><p>"Well, I shan't go, at any rate," said Alice; "besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now."
</p><p>"It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King.
</p><p>"Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily.
</p><p>"Consider your verdict," he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.
</p><p>"There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty," said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; "this paper has just been picked up."

</p><p>"I haven't opened it yet," said the White Rabbit, "but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody."
</p><p>"It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know."
</p><p>"Who is it directed to?" said one of the jurymen.
</p><p>"It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's nothing written on the <i>outside</i>." He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added, "It isn't a letter after all: it's a set of verses."
</p><p>"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.
</p><p>"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest thing about it." (The jury all looked puzzled.)
</p><p>"He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)

</p><p>"If you didn't sign it," said the King, "that only makes the matter worse. You <i>must</i> have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man."
</p><p>There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.
</p><p>"That <i>proves</i> his guilt," said the Queen.
</p><p>"It proves nothing of the sort!" said Alice. "Why, you don't even know what they're about!"
</p><p>"Read them," said the King.
</p><p>The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?" he asked.
</p><p>"Begin at the beginning," the King said, gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop."
</p><p>These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

</p><p>"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. '—<i>said I could not swim</i>—' you can't swim, can you?" he added, turning to the Knave.
</p><p>The Knave shook his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)
</p><p>"All right, so far," said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: "<span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span><i>We know it to be true</i>—' that's the jury, of course— <span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span><i>I gave her one, they gave him two</i>—' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know—"

</p><p>"Wake up, Alice dear!" said her sister; "why, what a long sleep you've had!"
</p><p>"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, "It <i>was</i> a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late." So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—
</p><p>First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that <i>would</i> always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.

</p><p>So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="id-192" data-page-number="192" data-page-name="Page:Lewis Carroll - Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.djvu/212" data-page-index="212" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:Lewis_Carroll_-_Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland.djvu/212"/></span>shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
</p><p>Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make <i>their</i> eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

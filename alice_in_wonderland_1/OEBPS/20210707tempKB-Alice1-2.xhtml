			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer of children’s fiction, notably <cite class="cite">Alice</cite><cite class="cite">’</cite><cite class="cite">s Adventures in Wonderland</cite> and its sequel <cite class="cite">Through the Looking-Glass</cite>. He was noted for his facility with word play, logic, and fantasy. The poems “<cite class="cite">Jabberwocky</cite>” and <cite class="cite">The Hunting of the Snark</cite> are classified in the genre of literary nonsense. He was also a mathematician, photographer, inventor and Anglican deacon.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Carroll came from a family of high-church Anglicans, and developed a long relationship with Christ Church, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. Alice Liddell, daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, Henry Liddell, is widely identified as the original for <cite class="cite">Alice in Wonderland</cite>, though Carroll always denied this. Scholars are divided about whether his relationship with children included an erotic component.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In 1982, a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled in Poets’ Corner, Westminster Abbey. There are Lewis Carroll societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works.</p>
